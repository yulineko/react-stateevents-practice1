# react-stateevents-practice1

- You have a regular component called DogCard, a container component called DogsList, an App component, and a dogs.js file that is exporting an array of objects
- On the DOM your application should show a list of dog images and a button for each image that says "Bark"
- When a User clicks on the "Bark" button it should render text to the screen that says "Ruff"
- When a User clicks on the button a second time the "Ruff" should be removed from the DOM
